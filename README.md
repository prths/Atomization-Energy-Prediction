# Atomization-Energy-Prediction
ML &amp; Dl Model without Co-ordinates and With Co-ordinates 

## Description
This project aims to predict the atomization energy of materials using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information about the chemical composition and properties of different materials. The following models are implemented and evaluated:
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Ensemble of Random Forest and XGBoost

## Environment Setup
To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed, preferably version 3.7 or higher. The required libraries can be installed using pip:
